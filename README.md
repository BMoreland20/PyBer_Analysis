Overview of the analysis:

For this analysis we are examining the rideshare data for three different city types urban, suburban, and rural.  During the analysis we examined the difference in the fares per city type and then per driver.  We also then calculated the average fare for both city type and per driver.

Results:

While examining the data it can be noticed that for rural ride shares despite having the fewest number of total rides and drivers the average fare per ride was the highest of the three city types (see image).  ![This is an image]( https://github.com/BMoreland20/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pyber_Summary.png)

From the image above we can also see that urban ridesharer’s make up the majority of the total rides provided, and because of this urban ridesharer’s had the largest total fare amount, and driver count.  We can also visualize that the suburban ridesharer’s share the middle ground  between urban and rural cities.
When examining a specific date range 01/01/19 to 04/29/19 urban has the highest total grossed fare amount with rural having the lowest and suburban in the middle (see image).

This result is very consistent with the overall summary of all of the data having the largest total fares and driver count residing in the urban cities, the fewest in rural cities, and a middling amount in suburban cities.

Summary:

For the large disparity between in particular rural and urban cities I would hypothesize that the cause of this is due to the average distance traveled of the ride for rural ridesharer’s being much more than their urban and even suburban counterparts.  To confirm this, we would want to also include the distance traveled data in another analysis and then determine the average distance traveled per each city type.  I would further my hypothesis that the rural ridesharer’s have much greater distance to travel to get to certain places, for example a grocery store would be much farther from a rural individual’s home than that of a person who lives in either the urban or suburban environments.

To address this concern, we could promote cheaper rates for rural users to help bring down the average fare dollar amount.  Since there are naturally fewer drivers in the area the change in millage rate would lower the average cost per fare.  This would also affect the average fare per driver as well also lowering this dollar amount as well.  This change could bring more sales from rural ridesharers thus not affecting the bottom line.

When looking at the suburban group of ridesharers we could promote for more drivers to fill the suburban environment.  This addition would lower the overall average driver fare but could increase the total fare amount for all of the suburban cities.  As mentioned earlier we would need more data on average distance traveled per ride to determine the best method of reducing rates to even out the average fare per ride while also making sure to incentivize that our drivers continue to drive for us.

Lastly for the urban cities we could increase the milage rate to increase the average fare per ride.  This would net an overall increase in overall fare total and average fare per ride and fare per driver.  This option would be less recommended as a savvy consumer could find a way to best play into our system.
